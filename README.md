Roku Accessibility Assignment

MMED 5006 - Multimedia Authoring 4


The objective of this assignment was to make a Roku app that was easily accessible for all.

Some of the features added to enable this:

- Adding CC (Close Caption) functionality to both the Movies and TV Show videos (for Hard of Hearing).
- Adding Lyric Video to the Music interface (for Hard of Hearing).
- Adding Zoom in/Zoom Out button functionality for those who have difficulty with sight.
- Buttons for Movie/TV/Music being big and bold and easy to see.
- Buttons for Zoom in/Zoom Out smaller than Movie/TV/Music to set them apart but still big and bold and easy to see.
- Buttons for both sections stand out from the background so they are distinct from the rest of the content.
- All features explained on website and white/grey colored to be easily seen on the background.
- All the text on the website is big and bold to be easily seen.
- Simple interface easily accessible to all.
